# `wv` R Package <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />


This repository holds the Wavelet Variance (wv) R package. This estimation technique computes the classical and robust wavelet variance for time series and regular lattices.

Below are examples of the capabilities of the `wv` package.


## Install Instructions

To install the `wv` package, there is currently one option: GitHub (Developmental).

### Recommended R Interface

We firmly recommend that any users of this package use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) over the default R GUI.

**All Systems**

With the system dependency taken care of, we continue on by installing the R specific package dependencies and finally the package itself by doing the following in an R session: 

```{r, eval = F}
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("RcppArmadillo","ggplot2","reshape2","devtools","knitr","rmarkdown"))

# Install the package from GitHub without Vignettes/User Guides
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/wv")
```

## Discrete Wavelet Transformation

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility 
set.seed(999)

# Simulate a Gaussian random walk
n = 10^3
Xt = cumsum(rnorm(n))
```

For the moment this method will only work with Haar wavelets. 

```{r, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for scales 1 to 4 for a simulated Gaussian white noise."}
# DWT
Xt.dwt = dwt(Xt)

# Summary of Discrete Wavelet Coefficients 
summary(Xt.dwt)

# Plot of Discrete Wavelet Coefficients
plot(Xt.dwt)
```

## Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform  (MODWT) for scales 1 to 9 for a simulated Gaussian white noise."}
# MODWT
Xt.modwt = modwt(Xt)

# Summary of Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Coefficients 
summary(Xt.modwt)

# Plot of Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Coefficients
plot(Xt.modwt, index = "all")
```

# User Guides

Various guides ship with package or are available on <http://smac-group.com/> to provide insight into how to use the different methods. At the present time, the following vignettes are available:
