# wv 0.1.0

## Features

This R package provides a series of tools to compute and plot quantities related to wavelet transformation and wavelet variance (WV). More specifically, it provides the following features: 

- Calculation and plotting of coefficients for the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT).
- Computation of WV and robust WV as well as of their respective confidence intervals.
- Visualization of the estimated WV with different options comparing classic and robust estimates as well as different times series.
