# wv 0.1.0

## Features

This R package provides a series of tools to compute and plot quantities related to wavelet transformation and wavelet variance. More specifically, it provides the following features: 

- Calculation of coefficients for the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation (MODWT).
- Computation of Wavelet Variance (WV) and robust WV.
- Visualization of a variety of quantities including WV, DWT and MODWT.
- Easy-to-use functions for spatial WV.
